How to spend your 5 daily “Gemini Deep Think” runs
(tailored to the patterns in your recent chats and to what Deep Think actually does best)

⸻

1. What Deep Think is uniquely good at

Capability	Why it matters for you
10-20× longer context window	Lets you paste entire pleadings, multi-file code snippets, or long economic proofs and get a coherent, end-to-end answer.
Chain-of-thought retention	Can keep track of nested legal doctrines, procedural timelines, or cross-file type definitions without losing the thread.
Structured long-form output	Generates 3-5 k-word research memos, architectural blueprints, or slide decks in a single pass.
High-precision code & math	Handles strictly-typed TS/Python refactors or formal economic models with fewer hallucinations.
Better self-critique	Will surface edge cases, counter-arguments, and weak spots you can tighten in follow-ups.

Use it when the depth and span of the work, not just speed, are the bottleneck.

2. Your highest-leverage query types

Based on the last few weeks you regularly ask for:
	1.	Complex legal synthesis – Rule 19 sovereign-immunity wrinkles, receivership offset doctrine, conflicts of interest for lawyer-founders.
	2.	Long technical research prompts – NSFW male-model comparison, OAuth-MCP server scans, image-gen training costs.
	3.	Architecture docs & refactors – Nix/Poetry/NPM mono-repo plans, RAG pipelines, batch-processing workflows.
	4.	Economic thought experiments – AI abundance GE models, labor-market equilibria.
	5.	Slide-worthy narratives – Partner-track AI talks, Westlaw Precision presentations.

These are exactly the arenas where Deep Think’s big context and reasoning shine.

3. Five concrete “ticket types” worth spending a daily use on

Ticket	When to invoke it	Example prompt seed (adapt to the day’s need)
A. End-to-end legal brief or memo	Any time a partner-level argument must survey dozens of cases or statutes.	“Produce a 4,000-word memo: may an SEC receiver offset gross vs net collateral recoveries? Distill holdings, split into majority/minority approaches, cite 15+ cases.”
B. Deep technical landscaping	When you need a survey + comparison + recommendation in one shot.	“Map the current OSS RAG orchestration runners (LangGraph, LlamaIndex, Flowise…). Rate on typing support, multitenancy cost control, and plug-in ecosystem.”
C. Architecture playbook or refactor plan	Multilayer diagrams, typed code scaffolds, migration checklists.	“Design a Nix-flake mono-repo for Next.js 15 + Supabase + Python pipelines, strict TS + mypy, dev-container spec included.”
D. Economic or statistical model write-up	Formalize rough ideas—you can later iterate with normal runs.	“Formulate a DSGE model showing equilibrium labor income share under AI price-level shocks; define equations and solve steady state.”
E. Flagship slide-deck skeleton	For talks/clients where story arc matters.	“Draft a 15-slide outline (titles + bullet cues) for a partner CLE on AI liability: strict-product vs negligence, contract carve-outs, insurability.”

4. Workflow hacks to stretch each run
	1.	Pre-stage inputs – Paste the statute sections, code files, or tabular data in the same request; Deep Think can digest ~80–100 k tokens.
	2.	Ask for a scaffold first – e.g., “Give me headings + key points; we’ll flesh out sections II & III next.” Saves follow-up credits.
	3.	Iterate in standard mode – Use normal Gemini/ChatGPT for polishing, shortening, or generating variants; reserve Deep Think for the heavy lifting.
	4.	Bundle related asks – Instead of three separate prompts about RAG cost, embeddings, and queue orchestration, frame one integrated “pipeline cost model” request.
	5.	Keep one slot free for “unknown unknowns” – A late-day curve-ball (e.g., emergency motion, sudden board question) often yields the highest ROI.

5. Sample daily allocation

Slot	Typical timing	Use
#1 – Morning	09:00	Draft that day’s most substantial legal/tech memo.
#2 – Midday	12:30	Produce an architecture/design doc or code-refactor plan you’ll implement in the afternoon.
#3 – Afternoon	15:00	Generate a slide-deck skeleton or economic model after client/partner calls clarify scope.
#4 – Early evening	18:00	Deep comparative scan (e.g., vendor landscape) for strategic planning.
#5 – Flex	Hold until needed	Emergency brief, large-context summarization, or serendipitous exploration.

TL;DR

Deploy Deep Think where context size + reasoning depth limit normal runs: gold-standard memos, exhaustive tech surveys, typed architecture blueprints, formal economic models, and flagship decks. Stage inputs carefully, ask for scaffolds first, and offload iterative polishing to baseline models to make each of your five daily shots count.
